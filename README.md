# Choice2Vec: Self-Supervised Learning for Behavioral Data

Self-supervised learning framework for behavioral data classification using wav2vec-inspired architecture in JAX/Flax

## Overview

Choice2Vec is a self-supervised learning framework inspired by wav2vec 2.0, designed to learn meaningful representations from behavioral data in two-alternative choice tasks. The model learns to predict masked behavioral features (choices and response times) while simultaneously learning discrete behavioral codes through product quantization.

## Data Generation Process

### Psychological Framework

The data generation simulates a realistic two-alternative choice task where participants learn reward associations between images across multiple subtasks. The key innovation is modeling **psychological states** that affect learning and decision-making:

- **Engaged State**: High attention, good learning, faster responses
- **Disengaged State**: Low attention, poor learning, slower and more variable responses

### Core Components

#### 1. Rescorla-Wagner Learning Model
```python
Q_new = Q_old + learning_rate × (reward - Q_old)
```
- Models how participants learn reward associations
- Learning rates differ by psychological state:
  - Engaged: α = 0.15 (fast learning)
  - Disengaged: α = 0.03 (slow learning)

#### 2. Psychological State Transitions
States follow a Markov chain with transition probabilities:
- P(engaged → engaged) = 0.92 (high persistence)
- P(disengaged → disengaged) = 0.88 (moderate persistence)

This creates realistic patterns where participants have periods of sustained attention or distraction.

#### 3. Meta-Learning (Learning-to-Learn)
The model implements adaptive learning rates that improve across subtasks:
```python
adaptive_lr = base_lr × (1 + meta_strength × subtask_progress)
```
- **Engaged participants**: Strong meta-learning effect (80% improvement)
- **Disengaged participants**: Weak meta-learning effect (16% improvement)

#### 4. State-Dependent Response Times
Response times are generated using realistic gamma distributions:

**Engaged State:**
- Base RT: 0.8s
- Difficulty effect: Harder decisions (small value differences) take longer
- Learning effect: Early learning trials take longer
- Shape parameter: 2.0 (moderate variability)

**Disengaged State:**
- Base RT: 1.2s (slower overall)
- Reduced sensitivity to task difficulty
- Higher random variability
- Shape parameter: 1.5 (higher variability)

#### 5. State-Dependent Choice Behavior

**Engaged State:**
- Choices follow Q-values with adaptive exploration/exploitation
- Temperature decreases with learning progress (0.4 → 1.5)
- Systematic decision-making

**Disengaged State:**
- 80% completely random choices
- Remaining 20% use very high temperature (4.0)
- Added noise to Q-values simulates inattention

### Generated Features

The simulation produces rich behavioral data with the following features:

| Feature | Description | Range/Type |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `choice` | Binary choice (0 or 1) | {0, 1} |
| `rt` | Response time in seconds | [0.2, ~3.0] |
| `value_difference` | Absolute Q-value difference | [0, 1] |
| `trial_in_subtask` | Trial number within subtask | [0, 99] |
| `subtask` | Subtask identifier | [0, 4] |
| `psychological_state` | True underlying state | {'engaged', 'disengaged'} |
| `learning_progress` | How well task is learned | [0, 1] |
| `learning_rate` | Adaptive learning rate | [0.03, 0.27] |

## Model Architecture

### Overview

Choice2Vec adapts the wav2vec 2.0 architecture for behavioral data, implementing a complete self-supervised learning pipeline with three key innovations:

1. **Selective Masking**: Only behavioral features are masked, preserving environmental context
2. **Product Quantization**: Creates discrete behavioral codes for contrastive learning
3. **Multi-Component Loss**: Combines behavioral prediction, contrastive learning, and diversity objectives

### Architecture Components

#### 1. Behavioral Feature Encoder
```python
Input: [batch, seq_len, 5]  # [choice, rt, value_diff, trial, subtask]
Output: [batch, seq_len, 256]  # Latent representations
```

**Structure:**
- 3-layer MLP with dimensions [64, 128, 256]
- Layer normalization and GELU activation
- Dropout (0.1) for regularization
- Processes both behavioral and environmental features

#### 2. Product Quantizer
```python
Input: [batch, seq_len, 256]  # Latent features
Output: [batch, seq_len, 256]  # Quantized features
```

**Key Features:**
- 2 codebook groups with 128 entries each
- Total vocabulary: 128² = 16,384 possible codes
- Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable discrete sampling
- Straight-through estimator for gradient flow

**Process:**
1. Split features into groups: `[batch, seq, 2, 128]`
2. Project each group to logits: `[batch, seq, 128]`
3. Apply Gumbel-Softmax for discrete sampling
4. Lookup quantized vectors from codebooks
5. Concatenate and project to final dimension

#### 3. Relative Positional Embedding
```python
Input: [batch, seq_len, 256]
Output: [batch, seq_len, 256]  # With positional information
```

- 1D convolution with kernel size 128
- 16 feature groups for efficiency
- Adds temporal context understanding

#### 4. Transformer Layers
```python
4 × TransformerBlock:
  - Multi-head attention (4 heads)
  - MLP with hidden dimension 1024
  - Layer normalization and residual connections
  - Dropout for regularization
```

#### 5. Output Heads

**Projection Head:**
- Maps contextualized features to embedding space
- Used for contrastive learning with quantized targets

**Behavioral Predictor:**
- Predicts original behavioral features [choice, rt]
- Applied only at masked positions

### Selective Masking Strategy

Unlike standard masking approaches, Choice2Vec implements **selective masking**:

```python
# Only mask behavioral features (choice, rt)
behavioral_features = features[:, :, :2]  # [choice, rt]
environmental_features = features[:, :, 2:]  # [value_diff, trial, subtask]

# Mask is applied only to behavioral part
masked_features = apply_mask(behavioral_features) + environmental_features
```

**Rationale:**
- Environmental features (value differences, trial numbers) are unpredictable from context
- Behavioral features (choices, response times) can be predicted from learned patterns
- Preserving environmental context helps the model learn meaningful associations

## Training Logic and Intuition

### Self-Supervised Learning Objective

The model learns through three complementary loss components:

#### 1. Behavioral Prediction Loss
```python
L_behavioral = MSE(predicted_behavior, true_behavior) at masked positions
```

**Purpose:** Learn to predict choices and response times from context
**Intuition:** If the model understands behavioral patterns, it should predict what a participant would do based on previous trials

#### 2. Contrastive Loss
```python
L_contrastive = -cosine_similarity(projected_features, quantized_features)
```

**Purpose:** Align contextualized representations with discrete behavioral codes
**Intuition:** Similar behavioral contexts should map to similar discrete codes, creating a structured representation space

#### 3. Diversity Loss
```python
L_diversity = -entropy(codebook_usage)
```

**Purpose:** Encourage uniform usage of all codebook entries
**Intuition:** Prevents codebook collapse and ensures rich representation vocabulary

### Total Loss Function
```python
L_total = L_behavioral + λ_contrastive × L_contrastive + λ_diversity × L_diversity
```

Where:
- λ_contrastive = 1.0 (equal weight to behavioral prediction)
- λ_diversity = 0.1 (regularization strength)

### Learning Dynamics

The model learns through the following process:

1. **Feature Encoding**: Raw behavioral data → latent representations
2. **Quantization**: Latent features → discrete behavioral codes
3. **Masking**: Hide 15% of behavioral features randomly
4. **Contextualization**: Transformer processes masked sequence
5. **Prediction**: Predict masked behavioral features
6. **Contrastive Learning**: Align predictions with quantized targets
7. **Backpropagation**: Update all components end-to-end

### Why This Works

**Behavioral Prediction** forces the model to understand:
- Choice patterns based on learned values
- Response time patterns based on difficulty and engagement
- Temporal dependencies in decision-making

**Contrastive Learning** creates:
- Structured representation space
- Discrete behavioral vocabulary
- Robust features for downstream tasks

**Selective Masking** enables:
- Learning from behavioral patterns while preserving task context
- Realistic prediction scenarios
- Better generalization to new contexts
